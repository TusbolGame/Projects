importantreasons=Normal accumulations of dust and dirt along with having pets, occupants with allergies or asthma, cigarette/cigar smoke, water contaminates, damage to home or HVAC system and home renovation can all increase the need for getting your air ducts cleaned.

# Residential Dryer Vent Cleaning
dryerventwarningsigns=5 Warning Signs That it's Time to Clean Your Dryer Vent
dryervent=Dryer Vent
cleaning=Cleaning
dryerventcleaningservice=LV Air Duct Care Dryer Vent Cleaning Service
lintclogs=Lint and other debris can build up in your dryer hose and vent duct, reducing air flow, backing up exhaust gases and eventually creating a fire. These hazards can be avoided by thoroughly inspecting and cleaning your dryer vent every year. This is particularly true if your dryer vent duct was not designed or installed properly. Not only are you reducing the risk of fire, you\u2019re also putting money back into your wallet by improving the dryer\u2019s efficiency.
fireprevention=According to the National Fire Protection Association, nearly 17,000 home clothes dryer fires are reported each year. These clothes dryer fires cause around 51 deaths, 380 injuries, and $236 million in property loss. Unsurprisingly, the leading cause of these fires, at 34%, is the failure to clean dryer vents.
dryerinfo=The lint from your clothes can build up inside the dryer vent. This material is highly flammable and can cause a fire. When the dryer vent is clogged, dangerous Carbon monoxide (CO) gases aren\u2019t able to escape. Instead, they build up inside the vent and may seep out into the laundry room and into other areas of the home. When it takes two or three cycles to get your clothes dried, this puts a lot of strain on your dryer. It can lead to excessive wear and tear on the unit. A dryer that is running more often than it should to dry clothes will use a lot of energy. This will be reflected on your monthly utility bills. Be sure to clean the lint out of the lint trap between each drying cycle. Regularly clean the dryer\u2019s vent cap on the exterior of your home. It is recommended to have a dryer cleaning professional to have them maintain your appliance at least once a year.

# Residential Furnace Cleaning
chimneycleaningservice=LV Air Duct Care Chimney Sweep Service
chimney=Chimney
chimneyintro=A thorough chimney and fireplace inspection includes checking the liners, smoke chamber, chimney exterior and firebox. The chimney inspection may detect structural problems that require repair. Fire safety officials recommended you get your chimney inspected and cleaned every year if your chimney is a major source of your winter heat or if you burn wood more than 30 fires a year. A regular inspection and cleaning also may save you from exorbitant repairs or fire damage in the long run.
chimneyfire=Whether you're burning logs or firing up the gas fireplace, chimney maintenance should be a top priority every year. Unclean chimneys are a leading cause of structure fires, according to the National Fire Protection Association, which recommends an annual chimney inspection. A 2016 report from the NFPA shows that home heating equipment accounted for 16 percent of home fires and 19 percent of home fire deaths from 2009 to 2013. Thirty percent of fires came from failure to clean the equipment, primarily chimneys.
chimneyregular=Chimney sweeps are something few people think about on a regular basis. In fact, those with chimneys in their homes often forget about this routine task altogether. There are enough items on the average homeowner\u2019s \u201Cto-do\u201D list already. Worrying about chimney sweeps is yet another thing to stress about. Like it or not, if your home has a functioning chimney, the need for routine chimney sweeps is unavoidable. Neglecting this pesky maintenance issue can result in air quality problems, structural damage and even fire hazards inside your home. Rather than roll the dice with a problem like this, it makes sense to get your chimney sweep over and done with when the time comes.

# Residential Furnace Cleaning
furnace=Furnace
furnacecleaningservice=LV Air Duct Care Furnace Cleaning Services
furnacemaintenance=Your LV Air Duct Care furnace cleaning is an extremely important part of your furnace's maintenance. Dirt and dust are its #1 enemy. A dirty furnace can result in many harmful contaminants circulating in your Las Vegas home. They include household dust, pet dander, debris, pathogens, allergens, chemicals, and dust mites. Although the air entering passes through a filter, the filter cannot possibly remove everything.
furnacedirty=The internal workings of the furnace becomes dirty. Hence, dust gets caught up in the system and then blown and recirculated back into your home. An improperly maintained furnace can also be dangerous. Carbon monoxide is a natural product of combustion and is found in combustion fumes, such as those produced by oil/gas furnaces. These fumes are normally exhausted from your home through the furnace'€™s venting.
furnaceprocess=Residential Furnace Cleaning Process
furnaceprocesstechnician=Our LV Air Duct Care furnace cleaning process consists of a technician cleaning all major parts of the unit, beginning with the evaporator coils, located just above the furnace (dirty evaporator coils diminish the efficiency of your unit, so having them cleaned can lower your electricity bills). The technician then cleans all the heating elements, eliminating scale buildup, thus preventing the unit from becoming clogged. As a result, increasing efficiency and extending the life of your Las Vegas furnace.

furnaceexperts=Most experts agree that furnace cleaning in Las Vegas should be performed at least once every two years In rare cases as often as every year for some households depending on multiple factors such as home with multiple residents, pets, and family members with allergies or asthma. A good rule of thumb is to clean the furnace and filter at each heating season.
furnacebenefits=Benefits Of Maintenance Services
furnaceefficiency=Regular Las Vegas furnace maintenance cleaning improves the efficiency of your heating system and helps maintain clean air circulating throughout the house. In addition to having your furnace cleaned regularly, you must clean or replace your furnace filter at least every 3 months. An indicator is when you can no longer see through it . Furthermore, your filter will need to be changed less frequently. Ask us about our filter change maintenance agreements.

ductworkissues=Ductwork Issues
uncomfortablehomes=Homeowners who have uncomfortable homes typically complain of the same issues for rooms that take too long to heat or cool, rooms that stay at different temperatures from the rest of the home, and homes that are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. In many cases, these issues can be attributed to one of these ductwork problems:
duckleakage=DUCT LEAKAGE
airescape=Duct leakage causes conditioned air to escape before it reaches certain rooms, meaning your heating or cooling system will need to run longer to get rooms to the desired temperature.
underinsulated=UNDER-INSULATED DUCT
missingductwork=Missing or inadequate ductwork insulation works against the HVAC system during heating and cooling seasons, forcing the HVAC system to vheat or cool the ductwork before proper temperature air can reach a room. HVAC costs escalate, and some rooms stay too hot or too cold even when the HVAC system is operating.
unbalancedairflow=UNBALANCED AIR FLOW
registerlocation=Unbalanced air flow due to register location causes some rooms to get too much heat or cooling, while other parts of the house get too little.

# Indoor Air Quality
indoorairquality=Indoor Air Quality
protectionagency=- According to the Environmental Protection Agency - Indoor air can be up to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air. There are a few things that can be done that may provide better quality air circulating in your home. Air humidifiers and UV lighting systems can both be an effective way of improving the air quality if desired. Overly dry air is often associated with itchy, cracked skin, dry nasal passages, and damaged woodwork & furniture. Adding a humidifier can help alleviate these problems by creating and circulating more moisture throughout the home. Humidifiers can also save you money on your energy bills, due to the fact that humidified air actually feels warmer than dry air and therefore your thermostat can be set to a lower temperature.
concernedair=Why Should I Be Concerned About Indoor Air Quality?
according=According to the EPA\u2019s booklet on IAQ, a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research indicates that people spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Their conclusion is that because of these factors, health risks may be greater due to air pollution indoors than outdoors. Additionally, groups who may be exposed to indoor air pollutants most often are usually also the most susceptible to the effects of indoor air pollution. These groups include children, the chronically ill, and the elderly. Those who suffer from respiratory or cardiovascular diseases must be especially wary.

# Exhaust Fan Cleaning
exhaustfancleaning=Exhaust Fan Cleaning
lvexhaust=Las Vegas Exhaust Fan Cleaning
veryimportant=It\u2019s very important to have an exhaust fan that\u2019s vented to the outside in every bathroom in your home. Also its vital to run it whenever you shower or bathe and for 15-20 minutes afterward to remove excess moisture. If in turn moisture builds up, it can cause mold and mildew to form. An average sized bathroom vent fan that\u2019s used one hour a day will exhaust over 2,000,000 cubic feet of air a year. That is the equivalent of the air inside 1,000 homes. In addition, as air is drawn through the fan, dust builds up on the grille cover and the fan motor over time. Cleaning the cover and motor housing every six months to a year will remove most of the accumulated dust.
moisture=Moisture in a bathroom can lead to peeling finishes, warped doors, and mold growth. In fact, the bathroom exhaust fans purpose is to control moisture and remove airborne pollutants. Maintenance of bathroom exhaust fans is quite often overlooked. Proper maintenance schedules will ensure quiet and efficient operation. It will also increase the fan\u2019s lifespan, improve indoor air quality and keep the unit attractive in appearance. Your bathroom exhaust fans should receive routine maintenance performed yearly by Las Vegas Exhaust Fan Specialists. Improperly installed bathroom exhaust fans are often vented into unsuitable spaces. Venting exhaust fans into these spaces can cause hot humid air to be discharged directly into your homes attic or crawlspace. Therefore, these conditions could lead to water infiltration and may impede the exhaust fans air flow. Nevertheless, Las Vegas Exhaust Fan Services will verify if the exhaust fan is clean and properly vented to the outside. At last, Las Vegas Exhaust Fan technicians are qualified and trained in bathroom exhaust fans and ventilation systems.
